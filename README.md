# HouseHold-Power-Consumption-Using-LSTM

They were measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values were available.

The data was collected between December 2006 and November 2010 and observations of power consumption within the household were collected every minute.


Database information:

This database have 2,075,259 rows and 7 columns.
*date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
*time: time in format hh:mm:ss
*global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
*global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
*voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
*global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
*sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
*sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
*sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.
